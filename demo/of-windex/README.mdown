This index is styled with [Windex](http://github.com/desandro/windex). Take a look at the iPhone/mobile view by shrinking your browser to below 480 pixels wide.

Windex - For a bright, shiny index
==================================

**v1.0 beta**

Windex uses PHP and Apache to style default directory listing index pages. It works directly with Apache's built-in directory mechanism.

Features
--------

* **Styled directory listings.** Windex comes with three lovely themes. Add your own theme by creating another CSS file and linking to in _header.php_.
* **iPhone-optimized view.** Shrink any browser to less than 480 pixels wide and you'll have a theme tailored specifically for mobile devices, perfect for the iPhone.
* **Nice default icons.**
* **README file contents parsed and appended to pages.** Windex looks for README files and adds them to index pages. It will parse documents marked up with Textile (_README.textile_) or Markdown (_README.markdown_, _README.md_, _README.mdown_). This option can be disabled in config.php.

Windex themes make liberal use of CSS3. Viewing experiences in legacy browsers may differ.

HEADS UP
--------

**Enabling directory indexes on a live site can be a serious security risk. Be sure to to install Windex only where you want the child files and folders to be viewable.**

Installation
------------

1. Copy the entire windex folder into your site's directory tree. For instance, if your site's files are in _/www/mysite.com/files_, upload this folder to be _/www/mysite.com/files/windex_.

2. Edit windex/config.php and change any configuration options. `$windexPath` is the absolute path of where the windex folder can be found. If your placed the folder to be _/www/mysite.com/files/windex_, you would change this line to be `$windexPath = '/files/windex';`. 

3. Copy and paste the contents of _main.htaccess_ into a file named _.htaccess_ in your site's files directory. DO NOT overwrite the contents of the previous _.htaccess_, as this code is essential to any CMS you may be running. Instead, add the code from _main.htaccess_ after the previous code. If necessary, change the file paths to the absolute path of the Windex folder (i.e. `/files/windex/...`). _.htaccess_ is a hidden configuration file. If this file does not exist you can rename _main.htaccess_ as _.htaccess_ and upload it.  **NOTE:**  it helps to know what you're doing before jumping in.  The supplied _.htaccess_ file may end up overriding some of your site's configuration and causing weird behavior. So understand what you're doing here, and merge your existing directory config with the contents of _main.htaccess_.

4. Try it out!  Browse to a directory that does not contain an index file.

If you wish disable an index page for any child folder, you'll need to upload a _.htaccess_ file in that folder with the following code:

    Options -Indexes

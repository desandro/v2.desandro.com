    	<p>Next week I start at <a href="http://nclud.com">nclud,</a> thus commencing my first days as a professional web designer.  It’s the culmination of a career transition that has consumed my life for the past two years.  I’m so excited to be working with great people who produce stellar work, but also to be able to work as a designer.  It’s exhilarating to think that this moment has finally come.  It was not long ago that I was fantasizing about being employed at a place like nclud.</p>

    	<p>Flashback a couple years: I was your typical post-college graduate working at a nondescript corporation, pouring endless hours of what-should-have-been my most fruitful years into a job that left me with little emotional reward. What scared me most was that I felt trapped in that place. All my chances to escape my current career were already behind me, so I simply had to play the cards I was dealt.</p>

    	<p class="example">If anything, I hope my story stands as an example that it is possible to take hold of your life, escape your uninspired job and start doing work that you care about.</p>

    	<p>You can read up more of the details about my journey in this month’s issue of FullBleed, where <a href="http://fullbleed.adcmw.org/articles/fresh-face-david-desandro/">I’ve been featured as the Fresh Face for August.</a>  Stephanie Hay wrote a great article on my career transition and a bit on my design philosophy.    It’s an honor to be a part of FullBleed.  The <a href="http://adcmw.org/"><span class="caps">ADCMW</span></a> and its contributors have been publishing terrific articles and creating a consistent source of worth-while content for fellow web designers.  Its another example of the great content that makes me feel fortunate to be a part of the DC area design community.</p>

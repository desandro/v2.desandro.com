    <p>This was an accident. I mistakenly reversed the incremental direction of the segments. Instead of breaking as it should have, it resulted in this organic serpentine form.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure of the math behind its movement. Each segment is trying to catch up to the one before it, but in the opposite direction. The most interesting shapes are formed, not when you whip around the cursor as one might expect, but when you move slowly. The small differences between segments gets amplified, producing expanding curvatures.</p>
    <p>As much as I appreciate well-structured content and finely crafted visuals, I find interactive experiments like one more compelling. While it may lack in any substance, its ability to entertain is what keeps me on the page. Like someone else built the car, but I get to drive it.</p>

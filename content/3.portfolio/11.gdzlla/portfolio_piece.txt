        Just like the application of GDZLLA itself, the illustration was created organically rapidly. Given a tight deadline, I relied on simple shapes as the foundational forms that make up Smash the mascot.  His head, body, and all the parts of his eyes are comprised of circles.<br />

        Smash takes center stage on the <a href="http://gdzl.la/404">GDZLLA 404 page</a>. Infusing the illustration with jQuery animation brought the mascot to life.

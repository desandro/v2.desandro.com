Poor ol&rsquo; Craigslist. Everyone picks on it for being ugly, but no one is willing to get their hands dirty cleaning it up. That is, until I discovered it could be done with userstyles.

    <div class="deet">
        <span class="point"></span>
        Look familiar? The userstyle adheres to the current Craigslist visual brand (or lack there of). My goal was not to completely overhaul the interface, but to enhance and address every detail in order to provide a more legible and aesthetically pleasing website.                           
    </div>
</div>
<div class="details deet2 note-top">
    <div class="dot"></div>
    <div class="deet">
        <span class="point"></span>
        By setting the total width of the content fairly thin, lines of text are kept to appropriate length, thus improving legibility.                          
    </div>

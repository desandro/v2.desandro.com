At nclud, we love our Mario Kart. To the viewer, welovemariokart is a simple website that visualizes the results of races. To me, this project provided the environment to experiment with new features of HTML5 and CSS3. Personal side-projects like these are the ideal playgrounds to innovate.

        Bezier curves are rendered with the HTML5 canvas element.

        Selecting settings is done with a drag &amp; drop user interface, using <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a>.  CSS3 box-shadows are leveraged to indicate UI states.

<div class="details deet4 note-bottom">
    <div class="dot"></div>
    <div class="deet">
        <span class="point"></span>
        These buttons are rendered purely with CSS, no images involved. The shading is achieved using a combination of inline box-shadow and CSS gradients.

At nclud, we love our Mario Kart. To the viewer, welovemariokart is a simple website that visualizes the results of races. To me, this project provided the environment to experiment with new features of HTML5 and CSS3. Personal side-projects like these are the ideal playgrounds to innovate.

        These buttons are rendered purely with CSS, no images involved. The shading is achieved using a combination of inline box-shadow and CSS gradients.

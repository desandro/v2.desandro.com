The nclud gang was throwing a killer party at SXSW 2010, and we needed a event page to help spread the word. As the conference and this party is about the interactive community, the page was designed just with web designers in mind. I wanted a page that would delight my peers, so I designed the entire site using HTML elements in lieu of images. The response was incredible. This silly little site was mentioned in several panels at the conference, which led to a tremendous turnout at the event.

        Leveraging <a href="http://typekit.com">Typekit</a>, I was able to deliver a rich typographic experience. Working solely with the <a href="http://typekit.com/fonts/576">FF Enzo Web</a> typeface, I mixed weights and styles to give the site a personality that couldn&rsquo;t otherwise be achieved  with standard webfonts.

        To create a dynamic list of the teams participating in the beerpong tournament, I implemented a simple sign-up form with <a href="http://wufoo.com">Wufoo</a>, that pulled in Twitter avatars.

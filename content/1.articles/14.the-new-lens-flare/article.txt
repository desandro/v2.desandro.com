    <p>By abusing the text-shadow property, you can turn any ho-hum bit of text into a magnificent, radiant beacon of allure and awe.  But getting your bling-bling on has never been for the cheapskates.  Expect to pay a boatload in refresh rates, as your browser buckles under the weight of rendering that glorious halo.</p>

    <pre><code>#content h2 em {
    color: #FFF;
    text-shadow: 0 0 150px #FFF, 0 0 60px #FFF, 0 0 10px #FFF;
}</code></pre>

I was originally writing this gushing review on 

I do have a point-by-point analysis on why Stacey feels better suited to handle this site

Here's what it boils down to:

Everything on the site lives together in one happy home.  The files are grouped together by entry. For a site like mine, where each entry has its own particular resources like CSS, JS, images, etc, this is especially beneficial as I don't have to hunt down the whereabouts when I want to make a change to a component of the entry.  The content, the presentation, the behavior all live in the same room.  I realize this goes against everything I ever read or have learned about best practices, MCV, or what have you, but it makes so much more sense when I'm working with it in practice.

As the entire site exists as a complete entity with a separate database, I can get to any part of it through nothing more than Finder and TextMate. The workflow of publishing content is condensed into just working with text files, and not having to work with the CMS itself.  No adding content to an entry, no add filenames to custom fields to link CSS or JS, no FTPing said files to the site structure.

As a complete entity, the whole thing can go under version control. Leveraging Git, my workflow has thus been condensed to: design and develop entry. Then publish the changes via Git. I can rest assure that my local copy of the site is the exact same one as the live site.

The templating language, even as primitive as it is, allows for enough flexibility to accomodate some creative solutions. Both the article section and portfolio section have their own variety of variables I employ. It&rsquo;s much like Expression Engine in this regard, where each section has its own content-type and I don&rsquo;t have to worry about one impeding on the other. That&rsquo;s something I couldn&rsquo;t say for my old horse, Textpattern.

Prior to discovering Stacey, I was considering building my own sort of CMS. Knowing some basic server-side includes, I could do the templating thing, but I faltered when I considered how to handle caching, feed syndication, and comments. Fortunately, Stacey addresses two out of three.  And I could live with losing comments. 

Even with me looking forward to making more stuff with Stacey, I do have hesitations recommending it to anyone else. 

The cunning simplicity of Stacey which makes it great, also provides for its greatest frustrations. As liberating as it is working primary through a text editor, I could understand how perplexing it could be to anyone who is well acquainted with a typical CMS. There are no plugins, no templates, no admin section. If you want to pages, you&rsquo;ll have to hack it.  If you want to display images 1, 2, 3 and not 3, 2, 1, you&rsquo;ll have to hack it. Flat out, there&rsquo;s a lot of functionality that you might expect (comments, pages, sorting content) and Stacey doesn't have it. 

Lucky for me, I feel it&rsquo;s a great fit. You&rsquo;ll have to see for yourself.

To Mr. Anthony Kolber, I would like to express my gratitude for creating and supporting this awesome resource. After watching the Get Satsifaction page for Stacey over the past couple months, I have been astonished at your level of dedication, personally addressing every menial hiccup and issue that gets thrown your way. As a fellow maker-of-stuff, its envigorating to witness someone who is passionate about his work. 

It is both a curse and a blessing that you released such a product in the current social climate.  I feel as though many bookmarked it and retweeted about it, but very few are actually using it. Consequently Stacey has not being getting the attention it deserves. In a space that is saturated with cookie-cutter templates, your creation is bold step into uncharted territory. My thanks.

        <p class="selected">I love fruit stickers. They are the favicons of print design. In the space no bigger than a thumbnail, they must display an identifying name and number, and establish a brand.<br />
            <br />
            These were collected 5 years ago, while I was studying abroad in London.</p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.stemilt.com/StemiltHome/">Stemilt fruit</a> had lovely stickers. They used every square micrometer efficiently, squeezing in a logo, an illustration and three text elements.  The ladybug fits perfectly in the the pull tab.

            These Chilean Royal Gala will perhaps always be my favorite. The yellow/blue/red color palette is attention-grabbing, reminiscent of vintage product packaging. The androgynous portrait still makes me wonder. Who is supposed to be? Why put him/her on fruit? Is that a star shape on the hat?  Is this person a communist? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Tragically, a couple years ago, fruit distributors started printing a new kind of sticker. While the fruit name and number were still visible, the majority of the area was devoted to a hideous barcode. I imagine this was a usability concern. How many times have you been held up in the grocery line because your checker didn&rsquo;t know the code for a Braeburn? I guess the idea was that she would be able to just scan it in, like every other item in your cart. To this day, I have yet to witness any checker scan in my fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
            The visual aesthetic of my collection was ruined. Areas of this collage were consumed with ugly barcodes, spreading like a growing tumor.
        </p>
        <p>
            My new strategy is to purchase fruit without barcodes if possible. For a while, these New Zealander Jazzes were my go-to fruit. They had a great crisp texture, bright tart taste, and most importantly, a beautiful sticker.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here&rsquo;s where my collection currently stands. I&rsquo;m resorting to covering up the barcodes and exposing only the designed portions. Those Stemilts, which once were a delightful decal, have been contorted to the point where the ladybug is hardly recognizable. I was excited to find the blue and white Royal Galas. The photo doesn&rsquo;t do it justice, but the stickers are actually reflective. It&rsquo;s encouraging to see that some distributors haven&rsquo;t given up on fruit stickers.

Main items on the Pending list involve repairing or removing broken links and collecting orphaned plugins.  You (anyone reading this) can help by pointing out articles that need repair — but if you could include a correct link or the plugin code/file to repair with, that would be a great help.  </p>

<p>Will also be “archiving” those articles/plugins that have become outdated due to new built-in txp tags or for other reasons.  There’s a bit <a href="/help#a910">more about that in the help</a>.  It’s nothing dramatic; just a practical feature to point out updated alternatives for some of the older and possibly antiquated (but still appreciated) mods/tips/plugins/etc.  Please point out instances that should be archived (and please include a link to the successor/replacement).</p>

<p>If you’re interested in helping more directly on the admin side, please drop a note to the admin (admin at textpattern.org or <a href="/contact">contact</a> form).</p>

		<p>Archived plugins/mods/etc. are those whose functionality has been built into the Textpattern core code, or is otherwise outdated.</p>
		<p>All plugins, mods, etc. that are posted to this site will be kept even after they have out-lived their usefulness â€” perhaps their functionality has been added to the Textpattern code so that a built-in Textpattern tag can fully take the place of what used to be a plugin, perhaps the plugin worked on a very early version of Textpattern and now is incompatible with the current and recent versions.</p>
